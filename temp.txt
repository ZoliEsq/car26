Matt comes from a firefighting family, 

Matt's passion of the Fire Department originated with his godfather, Joseph C Watkins, who was a member of the Plainville Fire Department from 1969 until he retired in 1997. Matt became a Fire Cadet in the Town of Farmington CT at age 12 and was with them until he was 17 years old. During this time Matt attended numerous events within the Fire department, including training drills, parades,  department functions, and much more. Matt Joined The Plainville Fire Company after graduating high school, where he loved being apart of a great organization but he had to take a step back from the live fire action. In September 2016, he became a member of the CT Fire Photographers Association, and began taking for a select few fire houses. He enjoys having the ability to photograph something he has loved for so long. Something that started off very small for Matt has grown in a short period of time to be something much larger such as In addition to having the ability to take photos within the multiple groups of first responders, Matt has also begun to broaden his ability to capture priceless moments in other peoples lives such as vehicle, engagement, and family photos as well as other special occasions. He looks forward to continuing his involvement within The Fire Service world and is looking forward to learning more about Photography.
